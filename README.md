## Description

This is an application for millennials who are looking for some fun activities in their city. The app uses centralized search tools under control features and provides them a scale from classy, clean level to dirty, adult level. The higher the level, the more R-rated the results are. Depending on which scale they select, the app returns a list of customized reviewed results on one side and their map locations on the other.
